# CIC Citizen Application Tracker

This repository contains a simple tracker for the CIC citizenship application. Since the official CIC tracker does not
provide email updates, this tool automatically logs into your account and reads the update date, then sends an email
notification with the updates.

## Usage

To use this tracker, install it using one of the following package managers:
For bun:

```
bun install
```

For npm:

```
npm install
```

For yarn:

```
yarn install
```

You will need a Gmail OAuth key in a JSON file, which should be renamed to `credentials.json`, to authenticate the email
functionality.

## Start the application

```
bun start
npm start
yarn start
```

## Environment Setup

Create an `.env` file in the root of the project with the following contents:

```
USERNAME= your_tracker_username
PASSWORD= your_tracker_password
MY_EMAIL= your_email
MY_NAME= your_name
URL= (optional) URL to the CIC tracker
CRON_SCHEDULE= (optional) cron schedule for the application
```

## Running with Docker

For now if you intend to run this application using Docker, you need to include the `token.json` file generated by
Gmail. This file must be obtained by running the application on your local machine first.
